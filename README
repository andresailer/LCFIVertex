The LCFI Vertex Package

releases:
 ----------
| v00-01-01|
 ----------
   - same code as v00-01
     the first official release except that
     cmake build is supported 


Installation: (using cmake - new build tool for Marlin v00-09-08)
-------------------------------------------------------------

 1st: edit the file BuildSetup.cmake according to your
      system setup.

 2nd: type the following commands:

    $ tar zxvf boost.tgz  # -- if not yet done --
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -C ../BuildSetup.cmake ..
    $ make install

    The documentation gets automatically built when you type
    "make install". If you don't want this, set the variable
    INSTALL_DOC to OFF in your BuildSetup.cmake
    Afterwards you can still build it with:
 
    $ make doc       -> all documentation (HTML+PDF)
    $ make doc_html  -> for the HTML documentation
    $ make doc_latex -> for the PDF documentation (refman.pdf)

Installation:
If you already have MarlinReco installed and working then installing
this package should only require placing the directory containing this
file in $MARLIN/packages eg. $MARLIN/packages/LCFIVertex

Documentation
To build the documentation, which includes examples of how to run the
processors in the package you will need doxygen 
(http://www.doxygen.org/) and pdflatex for the pdf
documentation. They are usually included with most linux distributions.
Run the following commands from the LCFIVertex directory:

For the HTML documentation:
cd doc
doxygen
firefox html/index.html
(or other browser)

For the PDF documentation (a subset of the HTML which does not include
all classes in the package):
cd doc
doxygen Doxyfile.latex
cd latex
make
(a file refman.pdf is produced)
