The LCFI Vertex Package

releases:

 --------------
| v00-02-03-pre|
 --------------
 
   release for full-chain tests for ILD mass reconstruction, fixing a number of small issues   
   found since last release and adding further functionality:
 
   - steering files updated to include steering file running FullLDCTracking, PandoraPFA
     (instead of cheattracks+jetfind);
     based on current version of steering file for mass reconstruction from ILD mailing list
     (Clare Lynch)
 
   - LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor: now compatible with RAIDA;    (Victoria Martin)
     corrected: "ptmasscorrection" --> "ptcorrectedmass"  (Roberval Walsh)
 
   - RPCutProcessor: small bug fix: this processor should not require GEAR unless hadronic
     interaction removal is selected  (Kristian Harder)
 
   - ZVRES: small bug fix in LCFIVertex/vertex_lcfi/zvtop/src/vertexfinderclassic.cpp
     to ensure consistency with ZVTOP paper  (Ben Jeffery)
 
   - ZVKIN: return IP if no vertices found;
     sort found vertices wrt decay length from IP, in ascending order (Ben Jeffery)
 
   - flavour tag inputs: code added to obtain new parameters for calculation of joint probability 
     from fit; currently only available if the package is run with JAIDA (Erik Devetak)

   - neural network code: 
      minor fixes: ensured code compiles with gcc 4.2.1; (Kristian Harder, Dave Bailey)
      missing "const" added;
      at request of CALICE added class to determine the importance of the input variables
      for a given data set and trained network based on the approach used in the TMVA package,
      see http://tmva.sourceforge.net/docu/TMVAUsersGuide.pdf p66 (Dave Bailey)

   - NOTE: with this version, a new dependence on MarlinUtil is introduced;
     this became necessary for the ConversionTagger processor, currently
     under development - don't use this processor yet!  (Kristian Harder)

-------------------------------------------------------------

 ----------
| v00-02-02|
 ----------

   - LCFIVertex/vertex_lcfi/algo/src/pereventipfitter.cpp changed to use Kalman filter for
     vertex fitting (reduces run time for PerEventIPFitter.cc by about a factor 100) 
     (Kalman filter developed by S. Gorbunov, I. Kisel, 
     Vertex Package interface: Tomas Lastovicka)

   - RPCutProcessor: for suppression of hadronic interactions using MC information this 
     processor is now updated to support arbitrary detector geometries (Kristian Harder)

   - LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor: new processor providing diagnostics for flavour tag
     (Victoria Martin)
     Please note -BUILD_WITH="AIDAJNI" must be specified to cmake to build LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor
   - LCFIVertex/macro/FlavourTagInputsOverlay.py: python script to create plots from 
     output of LCFIAIDAPlotProcessor (Victoria Martin)
   - LCFIVertex/macro/MakePurityVsEfficiencyRootPlot.C: root macro to plot purity vs
     efficiency graphs that can be written out by PlotProcessor, if compiling with root 
     option; permits results from different runs (e.g. with different settings) to be 
     compared (Kristian Harder) 

   - vertex charge calculation: correction of algorithm to agree with the procedure developed
     with fast MC (Erik Devetak)
   - separate VertexChargeProcessor, storing results in separate LCFloatVec collections;
     this used to be done in FlavourTagInputsProcessor
     (Erik Devetak)

For further details on these changes, please see the documentation.

 ----------
| v00-01-01|
 ----------
   - same code as v00-01
     the first official release except that
     cmake build is supported 


Installation: (using cmake - new build tool for Marlin v00-09-08)
-------------------------------------------------------------

 1st: edit the file BuildSetup.cmake according to your
      system setup.

 2nd: type the following commands:

    $ tar zxvf boost.tgz  # -- if not yet done --
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -C ../BuildSetup.cmake ..
    $ make install

    The documentation gets automatically built when you type
    "make install". If you don't want this, set the variable
    INSTALL_DOC to OFF in your BuildSetup.cmake
    Afterwards you can still build it with:
 
    $ make doc       -> all documentation (HTML+PDF)
    $ make doc_html  -> for the HTML documentation
    $ make doc_latex -> for the PDF documentation (refman.pdf)

-------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
If you already have MarlinReco installed and working then installing
this package should only require placing the directory containing this
file in $MARLIN/packages eg. $MARLIN/packages/LCFIVertex

Documentation
To build the documentation, which includes examples of how to run the
processors in the package you will need doxygen 
(http://www.doxygen.org/) and pdflatex for the pdf
documentation. They are usually included with most linux distributions.
Run the following commands from the LCFIVertex directory:

For the HTML documentation:
cd doc
doxygen
firefox html/index.html
(or other browser)

For the PDF documentation (a subset of the HTML which does not include
all classes in the package):
cd doc
doxygen Doxyfile.latex
cd latex
make
(a file refman.pdf is produced)
