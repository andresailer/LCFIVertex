The LCFI Vertex Package

Installation:
If you already have MarlinReco installed and working then installing
this package should only require placing the directory containing this
file in $MARLIN/packages eg. $MARLIN/packages/LCFIVertex

Documentation
To build the documentation, which includes examples of how to run the
processors in the package you will need doxygen 
(http://www.doxygen.org/) and pdflatex for the pdf
documentation. They are usually included with most linux distributions.
Run the following commands from the LCFIVertex directory:

For the HTML documentation:
cd doc
doxygen
firefox html/index.html
(or other browser)

For the PDF documentation (a subset of the HTML which does not include
all classes in the package):
cd doc
doxygen Doxyfile.latex
cd latex
make
(a file refman.pdf is produced)
